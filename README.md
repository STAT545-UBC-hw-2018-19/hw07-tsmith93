# Homework 07: Building your own R package
------------------------------------------

In this repository, you will find the components for my homework 7. The objective of this assignment was to expand on the [powers package](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers) created by Vincenzo Coia from the University of British Columbia's Department of Statistics.

Below is a list of this repository's contents in order of importance:

1. [Powers package folder](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tsmith93/tree/master/powers-tsmith93)
2. The [.RProj file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tsmith93/blob/master/hw07-tsmith93.Rproj)
3. An [.RProj.user folder](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-tsmith93/tree/master/.Rproj.user) you can **ignore**
